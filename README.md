This repository uses fa22 UC Berkeley skeleton, instructed by Peyrin Kau. I finish this repository in sp23 to learn computer security on my own.
My implementation of proj2 is in https://github.com/Eric-Wei-10/Secure-File-Sharing-System.git. But without test cases in Gradescope, I can't know the robustness of my implementation
